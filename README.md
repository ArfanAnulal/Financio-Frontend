### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/financio-frontend.git
cd financio-frontend
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables
Create a `.env` file 
in the root of the project and add:
```bash
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

- During development, use your local backend URL.

- In production, set `VITE_BACKEND_URL` to your deployed backend's URL.

### 4. Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
This will create an optimized production build in the dist/ folder.

### 6. Deployment
You can deploy the production build to any static site hosting service (like Vercel, Netlify, or your custom server). Just ensure the `VITE_BACKEND_URL` 
is set to the correct backend endpoint in your deployed environment.
